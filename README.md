# Simple-Version-of-Among-Us
Description: Program displays a very simple and randomized version of the video game; 'Among Us'. This game starts 
with 100 white circles representing 98 crew mates and two imposters. The crew mates can do nothing, but move around 
the canvas, the imposters can 'kill' a crew mate when the two touch. Once an imposter reaches 15 kills, their color 
changes to a light pink to indicate that they are 'sus' (suspicious). After 40 kills, the imposter's color changes 
to red which indicates that they are an imposter. Once an imposter reaches 45 kills, if they touch a crew mate, 
there is a 50 percent chance for the imposter or crew mate to die. If there are only imposters left, imposters win 
the game and vice versa. To start a new game, simply stop the program and run it again. The random module and 
three_shapes_game is imported. three_shapes_game.py was a file given to us by our professor, Russ Lewis. This file 
defines a game class for us to use and provides us with many mechanics for our games.

What I learned: 
	▪	how to create classes/objects
	▪	how to have objects/classes interact with aspects like other objects/classes, the edge of the screen, etc.
