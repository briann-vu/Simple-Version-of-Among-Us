Purpose: Program displays a very simple and randomized version
    of the video game; 'Among Us'. This game starts with 100
    white circles representing 98 crewmates and two imposters.
    The crewmates can do nothing, but move around the canvas, the
    imposters can 'kill' a crewmate when the two touch. Once an
    imposter reaches 15 kills, their color changes to a light pink
    to indicate that they are 'sus' (suspicious). After 40 kills,
    the imposter's color changes to red which indicates that they
    are an imposter. Once an imposter reaches 45 kills, if they touch
    a crewmate, there is a 50 percent chance for the imposter or crewmate
    to die. If there are only imposters left, imposters win the game and
    vice versa. To start a new game, simply stop the program and run it
    again. The random module and three_shapes_game is imported.
